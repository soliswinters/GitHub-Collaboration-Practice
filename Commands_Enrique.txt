This is the file that will have all the commands I have run so far:

Clone repository: 

git clone https://github.com/evalencialopez/Socio273L.git

We create a folder called project 1:
pwd
cd Desktop/
cd Socio273L/

mkdir "Project 1"

Create text:

vim "command_text.txt"

Then to commit this piece of text:

(escape):wq
git add "command_text.txt"

git commit -m "This is an updated version of the command line"

git push 

git pull
